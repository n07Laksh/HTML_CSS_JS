      अब वो दिन दूर नहीं जब पति-पत्नी के बीच डिजिटल लड़ाई कुछ इस तरह होगी
      बीवी- ना जाने कौन-सी घड़ी में मैंने तुम्हारी Friend request accept की थी ।
      पति- पत्थर पड़ गये थे मेरी अक्ल पे जो तुम्हारी DP को Nice Pic कहा था ।
      बीवी- मेरी अक्ल पे भी परदा पड़ा था जो तुम्हारी Pic पे Handsome Look का comment किया था ।
      पति- अच्छा होता तुम्हें उसी वक्त unfriend कर देता...
      बीवी- मैंने भी उसी वक्त तुम्हें Block किया होता तो आज ये दिन ना देखना पड़ता ।
      
       
     
      टीचर- इतने दिन कहां थे, स्कूल क्यों नहीं आए?
      
      गोलू- बर्ड फ्लू हो गया था मैम।
      
      टीचर- पर ये तो पक्षियों को होता है इंसानों को नहीं।
      
      गोलू- इंसान समझा ही कहां आपने...रोज तो मुर्गा बना देती हो..!!

      संता (कुछ पल सोचकर कहा)- मैं 6 केले खा सकता हूँ।
      बंता ने हँसते हुए जवाब दिया- गलत जवाब दोस्त,
      पहला केला खा लेने के बाद तुम्हारा पेट खाली कहां रहेगा !?
      इसलिए खाली पेट होने पर तुम केवल
      एक ही केला खा सकते हो। 
      संता घर पहुंचा और जाते ही बीवी से सवाल किया
      तुम खाली पेट होने पर कितने केले खा सकती हो?
      बीवी- मैं 4 केले खा सकती हूँ।

      दो लड़कियां बस में सीट के लिए लड़ रही थीं
      कंडक्टर- अरे क्यों लड़ रही हो,
      जो उम्र में सबसे बड़ी है वो बैठ जाए
      फिर क्या, पूरे रास्ते दोनों खड़ी ही रहीं
      ------




      लड़का- ओए पगली! हम तो दुश्मन भी शेर जैसे रखते हैं,
      तू है एक कोमल कली, मुझसे पंगा जरा सोच समझ कर ले,
      क्युंकि मैं एक शेर कि औलाद हुँ…
      लड़की- अच्छा तो एक बात बता  
      शेर घर पर आया था, या आंटी जंगल गयी थी…
      #सोलिड वाली बेईज्जती…
      --------





      लडका : मैं उस लडकी से शादी करुंगा,
      जो मेहनती हो,
      सादगी से रहती हो,
      घर को संवारकर रखती हो,
      आज्ञाकारी हो।
      प्रेमिका: मेरे घर आ जाना,
      ये सारे गुण मेरी नौकरानी में है</pre>
